This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on analyzing Play Store apps data. The Play Store is a significant platform for Android app developers, offering vast potential for app-making businesses to thrive. By extracting actionable insights from the available data, developers can gain valuable knowledge to capture the Android market successfully.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to explore and analyze the Google Play Store apps dataset, which includes information such as category, rating, size, and more. Additionally, a dataset containing customer reviews of the Android apps is provided. The goal is to discover key factors that contribute to app engagement and overall success.

## Summary 
Google Play Store is an official app store developed and managed by Google for Android mobile devices. It provides a platform for users to discover, download, and install various applications, games, music, movies, TV shows, books, and magazines on their Android devices. The Play Store allows developers to publish their applications and content to reach a vast audience of Android users worldwide. With over 2.8 million apps and over 100 billion downloads, the Play Store is the largest app store for Android users, offering a wide variety of free and paid apps to meet users' needs and preferences.

In our project we have provided with two datasets-

1.Playstore dataset- It consists of 13 column which has App,Category,Rating,Reviews,Size,Installs,Type,Price,Genres,Content Rating,Last updated,Current Ver,Android Ver and 10842 rows which has all the information with respect to corresponding column.Dataset also has null values and duplicates which is handled by us.

2 User review dataset- It consists of 5 column which has App,Translated_Review,Sentiment,Sentiment_subjectivity,Sentiment_polarity and 64296 rows which has all information with respect to corresponding column.Dataset also has null values and duplicates which is handled by us.

The main objective ot this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on both datasets and aim to extract key insights which is crucial to improve app performance,user experience and identify the key factors driving the app success.

The project will explore key questions such as: What are the most common user complaints or praises about the apps? Which categories of apps are most reviewed and what are their average ratings? What are the most popular apps and how do they perform across different categories? Are there any relationships between app size, installs, ratings, and reviews?

We will present our findings through data visualizations such as heatmaps, scatter plots, bar graphs,Histogram to make the results easy to understand and interpret. The insights generated from this analysis could provide valuable information to app developers and business owners to make data-driven decisions and improve the user experience of their apps.

## Conclusion
Conclusions which are derived from Exploratory Data Analysis of both Datasets are as follows -

1.'FACEBOOK' app has received the highest reviews.

2.Majority of the apps are accessed by 'EVERYONE'[i.e of all age groups,(81.82%)].

3.App belongs to Category 'Family' has maximum distribution over the playstore but have lesser installation because of its high price.
